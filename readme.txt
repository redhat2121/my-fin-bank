I'm excited to share my progress on the "MyFinBank" project. I've successfully implemented most of the functionalities outlined in the problem statement. However, I'm facing some challenges with the JSON server, particularly concerning the complete integration of CRUD operations.

Additionally, I want to ensure that upon starting the application, both the "/assets/users.json" file for authentication and registration using JSON Server and the "server.js" file for enabling simultaneous functionality of buttons in the admin/customers component are running smoothly.

Thank you for your assistance!
